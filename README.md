# Procedural Music Maker / Online Sequencer
Development of a online sequencer with procedural generation of melodies

This is a little tool that I'm developing for musical purposes.

It could be used to make infinite and adaptative music for games, mainly for open world games.

But, for now, it's only a prototype on Unity, hope to develop it a little more as soon as I can.

I'm planning to work on:
- Procedural melody generation (OK!)
- Multiple voices for melody (OK!)
- Adaptative, parametrical design (in dev)
- Friendly user interface (in dev)
- Harmony
- Rhythm
- Bass
- MIDI output for download
- Full documentation for use-as-asset purposes
