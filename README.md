# Online-Sequencer_ProcJam
Development of a online sequencer with procedural generation of melodies

This is a little tool that I'm developing for musical purposes.

It could be used to make infinite and adaptative music for games, mainly for open world games (at least in my mind, haha).

But, for now, it's only a prototype.

I'm working on:
- Procedural melody generation (OK!)
- Multiple voices for melody (OK!)
- Adaptative, parametrical design (in dev)
- Friendly user interface (in dev)
- Harmony
- Rhythm
- Bass
- MIDI output for download
- Full documentation for use-as-asset purposes
